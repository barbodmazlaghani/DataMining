Overview
This assignment focuses on data analysis and visualization using Python, specifically leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary dataset is weather-related data from Australia, and the tasks include both theoretical questions and practical data processing and analysis exercises.

Sections
Theoretical Questions:

Identify the type of data (Continuous, Discrete, Binary, Nominal, or Ordinal) for given attributes and suggest suitable charts for visualization.
Calculate statistical metrics like mean, median, and quartiles for two given data series and compare them using box plots and histograms.
Normalize data and compare distributions using Q-Q plots and determine if two characteristics are correlated.
Practical Implementation:

Data Preprocessing:
Merge data from multiple weather stations, handle data types, and reduce memory usage.
Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.
Ensure consistent temperature units across the dataset.
Data Visualization:
Create various plots (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) to visualize the relationships and distributions in the dataset.
Explore correlations between different variables and visualize them effectively.
Classify temperature data into different categories (e.g., very cold, cold, normal, warm, very warm) and analyze the frequency of these categories across different weather stations.
Reporting:

Submit a well-organized report including all code, visualizations, and a summary of findings. Ensure the report is clear and readable, following the provided guidelines.
The code must be executable with necessary configurations mentioned in the report.
