Overview
This assignment focuses on data warehousing concepts, specifically OLAP operations, cuboids, and iceberg cubes. Additionally, it involves practical data processing tasks using Python and data analysis on a weather dataset.

Sections
Theoretical Questions:

Question 1:
Design a star schema for a data warehouse storing information about international flights based on origin, destination, and time, with metrics like ticket prices and passenger count.
Perform OLAP operations to compare average ticket prices for flights from Tehran to Milan and Amsterdam during specific months.
Question 2:
Discuss optimal traversal order for cuboid construction in a data warehouse with specified dimensions.
Calculate the storage required for a data cube given specific parameters.
Suggest methods for efficient computation of cuboids with fewer dimensions.
Question 3:
Analyze a given cuboid for non-empty cells, aggregate cells, and minimum support.
Calculate the number of non-empty and aggregated cells under different conditions.
Question 4:
Implement the BUC (Bottom-Up Computation) algorithm to calculate an iceberg cube from a dataset representing customer information.
Determine the optimal dimension processing order and execute the algorithm with a specified minimum support.
Practical Implementation:

Data Preprocessing:
Use Python for data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data types in a weather dataset.
Data Analysis:
Calculate specific statistics from the dataset, such as the average rainfall, number of rainy days, maximum recorded humidity, and temperature differences.
Propose efficient methods for calculating these metrics with incremental capabilities.
