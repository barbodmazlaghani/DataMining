Overview
This assignment involves working with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to classify nodes within a graph, using a dataset from a GitHub social network. The tasks include data analysis, model implementation, and theoretical questions related to the application of GNNs in recommendation systems.

Sections
Introduction:

The primary goal is to classify nodes in a graph using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) model. The dataset provided (musae-github) represents a social network of GitHub users, and the task is to determine whether a user is a machine learning developer based on their connections and other features.
Dataset:

The dataset consists of nodes representing GitHub users and edges representing the connections between them. Each node has a set of features and labels indicating whether the user is a machine learning developer.
Practical Implementation:

Data Analysis:
Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of labels and features.
Check for class imbalance and suggest solutions if the dataset is not balanced.
Model Development:
Design and implement a GCNN model to classify the nodes in the graph.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the GCNN model and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
Evaluation:
Report the performance of the model on the test set.
Discuss any challenges encountered and how they were addressed.
Theoretical Questions:

Recommender System with GNN:
You are tasked with designing a recommendation system using GNNs for a platform with numerous products and user interactions (e.g., views, purchases, ratings).
Explain why GNNs are suitable for this task and how you would represent the graph for input into the GNN.
Discuss how the embeddings generated by the GNN can assist in making product recommendations.
Identify potential limitations and challenges of using GNNs in recommendation systems and propose solutions.
